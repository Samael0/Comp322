# Lab 0 - Making Sense of Ones and Zeros

## How To Run
1. Create text file with as many group of binary (name text file as "data")
    * If you wish to change the text file and use the makefile then remember to change it inside the makefile as well
    * You can also run the program alone without a text file to type inside the program
2. Run the makefile with `make`and it will compile and run automatically
    * If not using a test file then run the function `makefile noText`

## To-Do
* ./lab0 should return error
* ./lab0 - Should return error
* iascii
* Input invalid
* Clean Up Code
* Optimize

## Implemented
* Reading a file
* Use stdin if no file proviced
* Original to ASCII
* Decimal
* Use printf(3) for output
* Parity

## Updates

* Update 1: Added ability to open a file and use stdin, Added Table

* Update 2: Added function to calculate values for table but not working. Endless loop

* Update 3: Added function to do original to ASCII and Decimal. Working on calculating parity

* Update 4: Program seems to be fully working correctly. Really messy code
